  @Summary:
    This is the Interrupt Manager file generated using MPLAB(c) Code Configurator

  @Description:
    This header file provides implementations for global interrupt handling.
    For individual peripheral handlers please see the peripheral driver for
    all modules selected in the GUI.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  MPLAB(c) Code Configurator - v3.00
        Device            :  PIC16F18855
        Driver Version    :  1.02
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 1.35
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 3.20
