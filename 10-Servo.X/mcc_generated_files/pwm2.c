  @Summary
    This is the generated driver implementation file for the CCP2 driver using MPLAB(c) Code Configurator

  @Description
    This source file provides implementations for driver APIs for CCP2.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  MPLAB(c) Code Configurator - 3.15.0
        Device            :  PIC16F18855
        Driver Version    :  2.00
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 1.35
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 3.20
